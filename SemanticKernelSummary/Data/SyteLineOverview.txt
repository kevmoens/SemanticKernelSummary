EXTENSIBILITY FRAMEWORK
Infor ERP SyteLine Framework

Infor ERP SyteLine is built with extensibility from the ground up.  The SyteLine framework gives you the ability to adapt the system to your business, rather than requiring you to force your business to fit the software.  The model in the SyteLine framework makes it possible to adapt the Infor ERP SyteLine application to new business requirements without incurring the high cost and delays involved in modifying or writing new code. This, in turn, makes it feasible to rapidly adapt the system to your business, while continuing to receive new features and fixes. 

In most ERP applications, adaptability is provided as a separate layer over the base application, so your ability to extend and build new functionality is limited. The changes you need to make will inevitably involve modifying the base application logic and that means modifying code. But the base Infor ERP SyteLine application is built with the same metadata-driven approach provided to customers, so your capabilities to extend and adapt the application are virtually unlimited. 

To meet these objectives, the Infor ERP SyteLine Smart Framework uses a model defined by metadata (data defining the application behavior, stored in rows and columns in databases); for the user-interface (forms), the business objects (IDOs, or Intelligent Data Objects); and business processes (Application Event System). In the metadata approach, changes can be kept separate from the base application and your changes automatically upgrade.

The Infor ERP SyteLine framework makes it possible to perform the following changes without programming: 

•	Extend any portion of any screen: By using the same tools as those used to build the base application, you can extend any portion of any screen, including new tabs, new fields, validation logic, and enabling logic.  You can even embed controls you write in technologies like Silverlight in any SyteLine form.  
•	Extend any business process: Using the the Application Event System (AES), you can define rules that execute whenever an insert or update occurs to any business object (order, item, etc.) in the application or when trigger conditions you define become true. These event actions include updating any data in the application, automating any process provided by the application, prompting a user or group of users to approve the change, integrating to an external application, or simply notifying users of the change.  Defining these types of actions is all done without writing code.
•	Extend any business object: You can extend any of the Intelligent Data Objects (IDOs) to create new relationships to other IDOs in the base application, add new calculated fields, add new tables and publish their properties on the IDO. You also can create your own IDOs over your tables. All of these are done without writing code, although if you want you can write your own .Net classes and have that logic incorporated in the IDO processing as well.
•	Add completely new functionality: You can build new functionality, such as new tables, IDOs, and forms as required by processes unique to your business. These are automatically deployed with the base application and automatically take advantage of other framework functions, such as translations, Web Service access, and the Application Event System.
•	Introduce workflow, automation, or other business process-level changes using the Application Event System without writing code.  With drag-and-drop editing, you can construct rules that can, for example, query, update and execute functions on any IDO, notify or prompt users, or invoke web services from external applications.  You can have your rules executed on a wide variety of events, including trigger rules you specify (e.g. item quantity on hand is below safety stock), or whenever data on an IDO is updated in various ways.  

This ability to extend and tailor the application helps you to lower the cost of your IT ownership and increase productivity for your business. 


  
SYSTEM
Home Pages

Infor ERP SyteLine Home Pages are Role Based Home pages where we have identified the
specific daily tasks of specific career positions in our customers’ organizations and defined the exact collection of information and actions that help you accomplish that job effectively. We call each collection a home page, the set of actions and data most closely associated with a specific, defined job in an organization, such customer service, controller or production planner. Infor ERP SyteLine Home Pages gathers the information that’s most relevant to your responsibilities and puts it at your fingertips so that you can make rapid decisions and finish your daily work quickly and efficiently. This information is specific not only to your role in the organization, but also to
the industry in which you compete. You can view and take action on the information from a single location on your computer.  That way, you spend less time searching for information and more time getting your job done.

•	Home Tab lists links to forms and activities useful for each Role
•	Charts - Hover your mouse pointer over any of the columns to see the data value for that column
•	Alerts, Tasks, Inbox buttons – Red and green indicators
•	Navigator Tab includes pre-defined queries that equip each role with information to make informed business decisions
•	Tasks Tab includes Alerts, Tasks, and Inbox
•	The Flow tab for each form contains a business process flow including links to help topics and forms appropriate for each form. Double-click labeled ovals to open help topics. Double-click squares to open forms.

 

Multi-Company / Multi-Site Operations

Infor ERP SyteLine is inherently a multi-company, multi-site, multi-lingual and multi-currency solution. SyteLine ERP allows your companies with work together or separate based on your needs. Here, a "site" or organization / company represent any place where work is done. Thus, a "site" may correspond to company headquarters, a manufacturing plant, or a distribution centre.

Sites and Entities: Sites have relationships with each other. They combine to form financial entities, supply each other parts, Ship-to common customers,  and share administrative functions. 
Sites may report to financial reporting units called "entities." An "entity" has a specific currency, a chart of accounts, and the capability to produce financial statements.  The entity is the highest-level organizational component. For financial reporting purposes, you can group sites under a particular entity. However, sites can belong only to one entity.

•	Inter-Site/Warehouse Transfers - SyteLine provides functionality for any one site to enter a Multi-Site Quantity Move or Transfer Order for items to be RECEIVED at that site from an additional shipping site. SyteLine also provides functionality for any one site to enter a Multi-Site Quantity Move or Transfer Order for items to be SHIPPED to an additional receiving site.

•	Centralized and Decentralized Order Entry - Any site can originate a multi-site order, and line items can be shipped from any site. Credit checking and inventory visibility is provided from site to site.  In Multi-Site order entry, you can enter an order that spans across sites. In decentralized environments, you can enter an order at any site.

•	Centralized Purchasing – Any site can set up a PO that encompasses purchase orders to be created remotely at multiple target sites. A multi-site purchase order can take advantage of quantity breaks from the vendor for items that are required at multiple sites. Items being purchased may be subject to a Master Buy Agreement. This option accumulates quantities of like items from one vendor, to determine the best quantity break available. You can create printed documentation that groups purchase order information from various sites.   Cross site vendor maintenance can also be done.

•	Multi-Site Linked MRP and APS - SyteLine supports site-based, linked MRP and APS. When you run the Planning activity in Global mode, the activity regenerates the plan at each site in order of site priority (defined on the Planning Parameters form). The activity generates planned transfer orders for Transfer items across sites. 

•	Multi-Site Transfer Accounting - Multi-Site Transfer accounting automates inter-company financial transactions and inter-company financial consolidation. SyteLine provides parameter set-up for profit/cost eliminations, and offers separate account tracking for inter-company profit, cost, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, sales, and cost of sales.

•	Manual Voucher Builder - The Manual Voucher Builder allows you to quickly create a voucher in one or more sites for a single vendor's invoice. On any site, you can specify the portion of the vendor invoice amounts to allocate. You can enter all or some subset of the vendor invoice amounts. You can use the originating site as the To Site. 

•	Multi-Site Journal Processing - The multi-site journal processing activity allows for the creation of a single journal processing form that will distribute transactional information into each sites respective MS Journal.  

•	Multi-site Vouchering - Multi-site vouchering functions enable a single user to create a cross site voucher based on PO generated receipts.  

 






 
System Manager

Management and Administration of the Infor ERP SyteLine system is carried out using various tools.  The SyteLine system is managed using various end-user tools, which are built into the product.

•	User Extended Tables Administration – Securely and safely change the schema of the database to add fields that may be required to provide specific user functionality

SQL tools are designed to aid administrators with the common tasks involved with managing SQL databases.

The database is administered using SQL tools, such as:
•	Enterprise Manager – Centralized view of SQL databases with access to all common administration tasks
•	Query Analyzer – Easily create, parse and execute T-SQL queries
•	SQL backup and restore – create automated online backup routines and maintenance plans to automatically protect your data
•	Query Optimizer – built in tool to analyze and maximize the performance of T-SQL queries


 
Integration Outlook 2007


For many people, especially those in Sales or Marketing positions, Microsoft Outlook is an
essential tool for communication and organization. You use Outlook tools to manage your
e-mail, your calendar, your list of tasks, and your contacts.

Infor ERP SyteLine includes a User Calendar, Task Lists and Sales Contacts that can be
tightly integrated with their Outlook counterparts, so you can work with the same information seamlessly in both Outlook and SyteLine. With the click of a button, you can selectively duplicate contacts, appointments, and tasks from either Outlook or SyteLine into the other application.

When you view e-mails in Outlook to or from certain customers, the SyteLine details for orders made by that customer display along with the e-mail, for easy reference when you reply to or call that customer. The details of SyteLine customer interactions are also available with the Outlook e-mail, so you can see all interactions with that customer and refer to ongoing discussions.

You can also add selected incoming or outgoing Outlook e-mails to the SyteLine Customer
Interactions form by clicking a button in Outlook.

Integration Microsoft Projects 2007

Infor ERP SyteLine interfaces with Microsoft Office Project 2007, and the interface includes an add-in that adds a "SyteLine" toolbar and menu option to Microsoft Office Project, similar to the ones in Outlook and Excel. This Add-In allows you to pull in data from SyteLine and also to send data from Microsoft Project to SyteLine.

The MS Project Add-In is very easy to install and configure.  Once the Add-In is installed you can create a SyteLine project from within Microsoft Office Project. Infor ERP SyteLine has the ability to import and export project task data to and from Microsoft Project. If you have MS Project installed on the local machine, import and export buttons appear on the Project Tasks form.

•	Assign Existing Work Resources to Different Tasks Using Microsoft Project


 
Integration Microsoft Sharepoint

If your company uses SharePoint to share information among employees, the SharePoint pages can include charts and lists that display current Infor ERP SyteLine data. For example, you can display a chart showing sales year-to-date by salesperson, or a list of customers on credit hold. If a list is set up to allow it, you can also drill back to open the SyteLine form that contains the data.

Infor SyteLine SharePoint web parts retrieve and display on a SharePoint site the IDO data from a specific SyteLine configuration. You can download, deploy, and configure these web parts, so that the web parts display specific SyteLine information. Administrators can include the configured web parts on shared pages, or they can export the configured web parts so that users can import them to their pages. Individual users can reconfigure each web part to point to a different SyteLine configuration or to log in with a different user name.

•	Display a chart based on a SyteLine IDO using the Infor Chart Web Part. 
•	Displays a list based on a SyteLine IDO using the Infor List Web Part. This is similar to the collection of information you see on many SyteLine forms. 
•	Drill back to SyteLine forms from Sharepoint.

Advanced Planning & Scheduling (APS)

To meet your lean manufacturing goals—to do more and more with less and less—lean planning capabilities are vital. Planning must focus on customer demand today, pulling to the customer due date and synchronizing the flow of material and capacity accordingly. Infor ERP SyteLine APS is a powerful solution that synchronizes the use of work centers, inventory, resources, and supply with customer orders.

With Infor ERP SyteLine Advanced Planning and Scheduling, you can rely on a solution that is built, serviced, and managed by manufacturing professionals who understand your specific requirements—above all, the need for processes to flow smoothly, without mistakes, unnecessary steps, wasted resources, and waiting downstream because upstream activities are late. Our solution helps you meet this goal by providing seamless advanced planning capabilities, increasing your on-time performance and throughput while reducing inventory and operating costs.

•	Greater visibility in planning—Our solution provides exceptional visibility into the lean manufacturing plans it creates. You get a continuously visible plan for each order, so that every order “knows” the jobs and POs it needs, and every supply “knows” the demand it supports. You also gain new insight into your inventory and your resources (machines, operators, work centers, cell, and facility utilizations).
•	Simultaneous materials and resource scheduling— Our solution concurrently plans all materials and capacity needed to satisfy the customer order. It balances available capacity with the actual projected workload without assuming that capacity is unlimited or "infinite." Plans are continually adjusted based on the changing dynamics of your manufacturing environment.
•	What-if capabilities—The “what-if” capabilities of our APS engine let users determine the impact of decisions. For example, you can insert a high priority order into your current production plan, add overtime hours, or outsource specific components. The system instantly determines which customer orders will be affected and how delivery timeframes will change.
•	Real-time promise dates— At the time of order entry, our solution provides the ability to obtain a promise date for the order which considers the finite constraints of both material and capacity. Users only need to press the CTP (Capable to Promise) button within the order entry screens. This powerful feature gives you real-time date promise capability at both the order header and line detail level.
  
Scheduling

The Infor ERP Scheduler calculates the dates and times to work on a subset of existing orders--those manufacturing orders that you need to complete in the near future. You can run the schedule over any horizon: a shift, day, week, month, etc. However, you will usually run it for a one-day horizon, and you will usually run it each day. The Scheduler adjusts operation start and end times, suggests operation sequences, and reports changes in inventory levels. It also generates summary information (such as job performance) you can view in reports and graphs.
The Scheduler processes individual operations for any Released jobs within the defined time horizon based on their routing and setup, run, and move times. 

•	Schedule Planned orders generated by MRP or APS, Firm jobs, Working estimate jobs, Planned estimate jobs, production schedules
•	Schedules jobs forward in time
•	Schedule resources to perform operations
•	Event-based scheduling
•	Utilize scheduling shifts, holidays, resources, resource groups, departments, and work centers
•	Prioritize jobs by setting sequence and selection rules
•	Use the Scheduler output analysis forms or Analyzer to identify late jobs and causes
•	Runs automatically in the Background Queue 
•	Dispatch lists by individual resources or resource groups
•	Graphical views of capacity and schedule
•	Schedule analysis by exception
•	Resource Bottleneck analysis forms


 
Material Requirements Planning (MRP)

Infor ERP SyteLine Material Requirements Planning (MRP) module assists you in managing the balance between supply and demand.  Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a mode of planning that plans requirements in order by the lowest level in which the item appears in a bill of material. That is, it plans all end items first, then all items at the next level, and so on, backward planning each requirement from the requirement's needed date to the item's lead time and batching together requirements needed at the same period of time.

Unlike APS, MRP does not consider routing times, resource capacity, or shifts. The responsibility rests with you, the planner, to make sure your shop floor has the available capacity to work the plan. MRP generates planned orders and exception messages to help you implement an accurate plan. MRP helps reduce inventory, increase manufacturing productivity, and ultimately facilitates cash flow.

•	Explode all assembly schedules into component requirements
•	Consume the forecast with actual orders as they are received
•	The master production schedule (MPS) allows you to control production of key end items to help you protect your schedule from fluctuations in order-based demand (forecasts, customer orders, parent job orders, etc.). MPS is a manually created, anticipated build schedule for an item. You create it based on your expectations of demand and your estimation of resource capacity.
•	Material Planning Workbench for automatic creation of Purchase Orders, Jobs,  or Transfer Orders
•	Run MRP for all sites or individual sites
•	Define a source per part – Manufactured, Purchased, or Transferred to define sourcing by site. 
•	Available To Promise
•	View Exception messages when exceptions occur such as on-hand quantity drops below safety stock, or when a planned receipt is no longer needed (or needs to be moved in or out in time)
•	Use the Order Action Report to determine the job orders and purchase orders you must generate and release for a given item to be available when needed
•	Replicate MRP planned transfer orders to the supply sites in your multi-site environment
•	Use the Pegging Display form to peg each supply against demand
 
  
Co-products and By-products

Many production processes result in more than one stock keeping unit (SKU). These additional materials may be Co-products or By-products. Infor ERP SyteLine allows you to model both of these products. 

A By-product is something that is a residual of or incidental to the production process.  You are not in the business of making the by-product, and if you could eliminate it from the process, you would.  But since it has value, you need to inventory it. 

Co-Products when you create many SKUs with the same job. 

•	Create jobs that make groups of items, rather than a single item
•	Create Co-Product Mixes
•	Both Actual and Standard cost types supported
•	Production schedules and Estimates are supported for By-products
•	Lot tracking 
•	Assign the cost distribution percentage between material, labor, and machine for each co-product job operation
•	Process job material transactions to record receipt of By-products into inventory




 
 
Jobs

Infor ERP SyteLine allows you to use jobs, also referred to as manufacturing work orders, to track specific manufacturing processes, including labor, material, machines, costs, scrap, work in process, and finished goods inventory. A Job is a mechanism to launch and monitor production to meet a planned requirement. It is very flexible and easily changed to meet a specific customer’s requirements and provides great detail in cost tracking and analysis.  It’s also a way to cross-reference production to a specific customer order that needs to be tracked in detail. Jobs have their own bill of material and routing structure and are individually released to manufacturing.  In addition, job definition for rework order processing is available, allowing for recursive item repair use with planning impact basis.  

•	Infor ERP SyteLine provides several methods of creating and defining a job and user’s can use the method they prefer. 
•	Use the Material Planner’s Workbench to manage the creation of all of your jobs in a single screen.

Production Schedules (Repetitive Manufacturing)

Infor ERP SyteLine Production Schedules are typically used when you manufacture the same item regularly - standard products - and do not need precise tracking of actual labor and material costs for every Job. Rather than being required to report all activity to a specific Work Order, SyteLine Production Schedules allow activities and their costs to be charged to Work Centers.  Production schedules allow you to authorize and release production in a simplified manner. A production schedule functions as a blanket job order. Production schedules are sometimes also referred to as work-orderless production.  With SyteLine’s Production schedules, you create production schedules for an entire plant, planner, family of items, or specific customer for a selected time period. You can set up a production schedule for an item with releases for each month of the year; you don't have to create a separate job order each month or each time the item is manufactured.

•	Allows manufacturers to be more spontaneous in authorizing production
•	More flexibility in making schedule changes 
•	Reduced effort in establishing and maintaining production plans 
•	Reduced paperwork and system transactions
•	SyteLine Production Schedules do not require actual labor and material tracking. Instead, after a Production Schedule is created you need only report the item produced and the quantity and the labor and material are backflushed
•	Costs are charged to the items produced in the work center based on the standard bill of material and routing
•	Track the cumulative production for an item in time buckets you choose (daily, weekly, or monthly)
•	Best suited for Make-to-Stock Finished Goods/Components, and High Volume-to-Order


 








Batched Production

Using the Infor ERP SyteLine Scheduler, you can group several potentially different items on different jobs into a batch and process that batch through, for example, an oven or a paint booth. After the batch is processed, the different jobs then continue on their own routing.  Batching affects only the Scheduler, not the Planner.

Each batch definition describes how batches are formed, including a routing that processes the batched parts. The Operations forms includes a batch definition field. Any operation on which a batch definition is specified is referred to as the batch operation. In a jobs or production schedule routing, an operation (the batch operation) references a batch definition when the job or production schedule can be combined with other jobs or productions schedules for processing. This causes batches to be formed, based on the rules defined on the Batch Definitions form, and transfers control to the batch definition routing. At the end of the batch definition routing, the job or PS returns to its original routing and continues processing as normal.

•	User-Defined or System Created Batches
•	Tell the Scheduler how batches should be formed including how jobs/production schedules will be batched together and when a batch will be released to be processed. 
•	Define operations that use the batch definitions
•	Create user-defined batches which include specific released jobs and production schedule releases
•	Define operations that use the batched production definitions

SyteLine Forecasting

For discrete manufacturers, many factors contribute to an efficient operation and healthy bottom line. One important factor that can get overlooked is forecasting—determining the right amounts of raw materials and components needed to meet production requirements. A manual, informal process can result in costly excess inventory or order fulfillment and production efficiency problems. At many companies, forecasting is done using inefficient and error-prone spreadsheets. To compensate, many companies maintain an inventory “fudge factor,” keeping too much inventory on hand. Other times, they maintain too little and consequently lose sales, incur expediting costs, or ship late. Forward-thinking discrete manufacturers overcome these
operational challenges by automating their forecasting processes with a solution integrated with their ERP system to help them quickly calculate more accurate forecasts and optimal safety stock levels.

Infor ERP SyteLine Forecasting automates the calculation of forecasts and other inventory drivers such as safety stock, and alerts you when actual demand varies from the plan. Infor ERP SyteLine Forecasting is easy to use, easy to implement, and automates the following forecasting processes:

•	Collect data. Infor ERP SyteLine Forecasting can collect historical sales of products or usage of components in both units and dollars.
•	Calculate forecasts. The solution can statistically calculate forecasts based on historical demand using various algorithms with what-if analysis. Forecasts also can be generated collaboratively, such as a roll-up of expected demand specified by customer. The solution also supports combined forecasting methods, such as when part of demand is forecast by statistics and part by imported customer data.
•	Analyze data. You can analyze forecasts, sales, bookings, or usage of materials by unit and dollar volume and compare forecasts to historical trends and compare actual demand to what was forecasted. Information is presented graphically by groupings, including product, family, commodity, planner, and user defined.
•	Adapt the forecast. After collecting and analyzing data, you can adjust the forecast for specific market factors such as promotions, competitive situations, and new opportunities. These adjustments can be made at the various group levels or at the item level.
•	Calculate optimum inventory levels. Infor ERP SyteLine Forecasting quickly calculates optimum safety stock, order size, and re-order points, factoring in average usage, variability, lead time, and desired service level.
•	Perform top-down forecasting. For configure-to-order products, the solution uses planning bills that allow you to calculate or specify a single forecast for a group of items and then consume that forecast when members of the group are sold. For companies that have common components but unlimited end-item possibilities, the solution enables you to forecast the components, rather than the end items, and consume the forecast when the components are used. This allows the forecasts to drive demand for components and for customer orders to drive demand for the top level items.

 

 
SyteLine SytePlan

Operations Planning is a business management process to achieve the alignment of all business activities to balance supply and demand.

SyteLine Quality Control Solution

Your customers require products made to their precise specifications. You require the same of your suppliers. You are equally committed to the same exacting level of quality within your company and across your entire organization.  You face endless challenges in complying with government regulations, providing quality records to auditors and customers, and continually making improvements to your organization.

QCS integrates best-in-class quality into the Infor ERP functions you already use to run your manufacturing operation. It supports quality activities related to receiving, manufacturing, shipping, and returns.

QCS also manages advanced quality activities across your entire organization, including quality incidents, change management, and responses to audit findings. Infor ERP SyteLine QCS creates the framework for building a culture of continuous improvement throughout your organization.

QCS supports quality activities of your entire enterprise, not just the manufacturing process.
The four distinct QCS modules, all built on a common foundation of powerful quality management tools, include:

•	QCS Enterprise - The QCS Enterprise module encompasses:
o	Topics
o	Changes
o	Web Portal
o	Process Flow

QCS includes support for quality incidents, change management, responses to audit findings, machine and maintenance issues, safety, training, and opportunities for continuous improvements. With Infor ERP SyteLine QCS, you can make specific reviews mandatory and require that those reviews get addressed as a precondition to closing a change-management report.

Because communicating quality issues and their status is such a critical component of any quality system, the QCS Web portal allows all employees to view quality data, without the need to log into SyteLine. It also monitors and reports quality performance data, and offers basic document management functions.

 
•	QCS Supplier - The QCS Supplier module manages:
o	Receiving inspection
o	Vendor Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA)
o	Supplier performance reporting

The process of managing your suppliers never ends.  Beginning with a review of the supplier facilities and an approval process, the SyteLine QCS Supplier module helps track vendor communications and quality control (QC) status. The receiving process of this module includes material handling, safety alerts, printing tags, assigning unique tracking numbers, and putting material in a QC holding area pending disposition. From here, QC inspects and assigns the material to inventory for production or tracks non-conforming material to its final disposition. It also provides integrated Vendor RMA support, including links with accounting. QCS automatically calculates vendor product quality and delivery performance to help you build strong supplier relationships.

 

•	QCS In-Process - The QCS In-Process module covers:
o	Job inspection and rework
o	Serial number tracking
o	Cost of scrap

Tracking quality requirements during production often becomes a chore, what with the need to record the disposition of materials at multiple inspection points, track sign-offs, capture test results, record defects, and track items requiring rework or repair. The QCS In-Process module streamlines your entire process.

Many situations require you to track and inspect manufactured items piece-by-piece, according to serial number or tag number. QCS supports all SyteLine production methods—jobs, production schedules, and just-in-time (JIT). It also allows you to enter all details while in a job, including disposition, non-conformance tracking, cost of quality, test results, defects, and failures.

In addition, QCS reports the cost of scrap including labor, material, and overhead. You can identify defective raw material at the point of use rather than at receipt, which helps you report the issue promptly. When you mark items as defective during manufacturing, QCS lets you track each nonconforming item and capture the associated costs of quality. In addition, when a job requires you to send material outside for processing, QCS prints paperwork to attach to the product when it leaves your facility and when it returns again.

•	QCS Customer - The QCS Customer module deals with:
o	Shipping inspection and QA
o	Customer RMA
o	Customer complaints

Customers may require you to ship paperwork with each product to confirm that you have designed, manufactured, or inspected the product to meet regulatory or customer requirements. The QCS Customer module improves your work process by identifying which items require such confirmation and ensuring that these items are routed through QC prior to shipping. You can record inspection results, print necessary paperwork and then tag the product as accepted and ready to ship. If your customers return the product, QCS works with the SyteLine RMA module to direct that product to QC for receipt, inspection, disposition, and non-conformance tracking. The Customer Complaint Reporting (CCR) function helps you respond to feedback from your customers, assign responsibility, track your internal review and corrective action, and measure customer satisfaction.

The Supplier, In-Process, and Customer modules are built on a common foundation to help you manage key quality requirements that span every facet of your organization.  This common foundation includes:

•	Non-Conformance
•	Quick Reporting of Quality Issues
•	QC Item Definition
•	Corrective Action
•	Cost of Quality
•	Record Inspection Results
 
SyteLine Advanced Plant Maintenance

SyteLine Advanced Plant Maintenance (APM) makes it possible for organizations to manage their entire internal maintenance process, from scheduling preventative maintenance events to handling the unexpected service repair.

Advanced Plaint Maintenance reduces equipment downtime, improves resource utilization, and streamlines service operations. It helps protect against unscheduled maintenance when part and materials may not be available. It helps prevent interruptions in production which can lead to bottlenecks in the system, inventory shortfalls and hampered abilities to fulfill customer orders.

Advanced Plant Maintenance seamlessly integrates to Infor ERP SyteLine and provides organizations with an internal system to manage preventative maintenance schedules and/or service repairs. It manages inventory, purchasing, accounting, shop floor and scheduling files. Any organization with equipment needing routine inspection, calibration, preventative maintenance, or potentially service repairs on equipment can benefit from this integrated service management solution.

APM helps the organization be proactive in its approach to maintenance of machine/tools/fixtures, fleet, facility or plant assets. A preventative maintenance schedule means fewer equipment failures.  Routine service can be planned according to a schedule that will least affect production demands.

Preventive maintenance reduces the threat of sub-par performance due to improperly maintained equipment and fixtures. Overall quality levels can be sustained. By maintaining equipment/tools/fixtures on a routine, scheduled basis, the life expectancy of assets is significantly extended. In addition, by tracking maintenance expense over time, organizations can make better, informed decisions about future “repair versus replacement” options.

Advanced Plant Maintenance helps profit-minded organizations enact such proactive, asset-protecting strategies. Now your organization can effectively manage the entire maintenance process:

•	Unit Configuration - To manage complex equipment, tools and fixtures, the Unit Configuration Screen can be used to track the detailed configuration of any date.  Each line item can have its own set of comments and its own warranty tracking information. SROs for PM, inspection and calibration can be generated automatically. For tools and less complex equipment, the configuration need not be built.
•	Automated SRO Scheduling - Each Unit has a Unit master record. SROs of any user-defined type such as “PM” for preventive maintenance or “INSP” for inspection may be established to automatically generate either on a time or meter basis. All SROs are tied to the proper machines and tools giving the user the ability to track all costs.
•	Resource Scheduling - When reviewing the schedules for a resource or resource group, the user can view “Shift Exceptions” for blocks of time required to perform maintenance on the resource. With a click of the mouse, the list of maintenance orders generated for a resource or resource group can also be shown.
•	Incident/Event Tracking - All service repair requests can be managed via the Incident Maintenance screen. Calls may be related to specific PM or SRO item or any item/part within the unit configuration. Full user- defined traceability is supported for multi-level reason and resolution codes. If a unit is identified as part of the incident, warranty information is made available to the user. Priority and status codes are a basis for escalation and reporting.
 
 
SyteLine FASView

SyteLine FASview is a productivity tool that extends the value of Infor SyteLine ERP in two ways: 

1.)	making it possible to view external files from within SyteLine and 
2.)	making it possible to send emails containing merged data from SyteLine fields from within the SyteLine user interface.

An unlimited number of Windows-supported document files can be attached to any field, wild-carded field or combination of fields displayed on a SyteLine screen. Supported file types include, but are not limited to, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, CAD drawings, videos, html, etc.

FASview provides built-in flexibility to manuallyattach files or automate the process. The user can
choose which approach-–or use a combination of the two--to meet the needs of the business environment and how the business documents are organized. Having both attachment options available allows the organization to maintain a standard file storage directory structure while at the same time providing the end-user flexibility to manually attach files as needed to support a specific job function.

The real power of FASview is in automating the file attachment process.  Automated file attachment links are set up via user-definable naming conventions (i.e., “co-num”) and a predefined directory structure. Files may be stored anywhere on the network or on any server accessible to the network. This approach creates automatic links between the attachment files and the predefined SyteLine field name(s) thus eliminating the need to manually attach each document to each SyteLine screen. For example, if a CAD drawing is linked to “item”, the CAD drawing can be displayed from any screen where “item” is displayed (i.e., customer order line item maintenance, job maintenance, job materials, purchase order item) allowing the linkage to go throughout the entire SyteLine system.

•	View Attachments - From within any Syteline screen, using a standard Hot-Key, a browser will appear that contains all of the documents that have been attached either manually or through the automated process. To view the document, the user simply double-clicks on the file name.

 
 
SyteLine RMx RMA Extension 

SyteLine RMx Return of Materials extends the functionality of the standard SyteLine RMA module through improved management of the disposition process, including “return to vendor” processing, as well as providing direct integration to FS-Plus Service Management. The disposition process is the means by which users evaluate/test/inspect the return to determine the appropriate “next step”. Items and materials can be tagged as scrap, rework, return to inventory, or return to vendor (for credit, exchange, or warranty repair). Seamless integration with FS-Plus allows users to efficiently manage the return material authorization process automatically from within FS-Plus as well as handle “Rework”, “Advanced Exchange” and other related service procedures. RMx Return of Materials Add-on Module works with your standard SyteLine system, Version 4.0 or greater, and/or FS-Plus Service Management System, Version 4.0 or greater.

RMA Disposition Maintenance - The RMA Disposition is the main screen used to enter disposition codes, item descriptions, and quantities returned, received or dispositioned.

 


Vendor Processing - The Vendor Processing screen is used to process the return. Users can keep track of RMA numbers, Line and Item numbers and quantities returned.

  
SyteLine Outside Process Management

SyteLine Outside Process Management (OPM) extends the value of Infor SyteLine ERP allowing the SyteLine user to streamline the process of tracking and shipping materials from a standard SyteLine job to an outside vendor/service. 

OPM leverages the “Outside Service” field on the standard Syteline Work Center to flag material that requires the services of an outside vendor. With OPM, no changes to the standard SyteLine Bill of Material are required. However, when the job material is moved into an operation flagged with an “Outside” work center, the system automatically creates a purchase order for the materials along with the necessary records to identify those items to be shipped and to which vendor.

Users also have the ability to print packing slips and ship items from a new Vendor Shipping screen. When the outside vendor completes the contracted service, items are received back into the job using the standard SyteLine Purchase Order Receiving functionality.

•	Create Purchase Orders automatically and cross reference the job.
•	Track partial quantities for jobs producing multiple items.
•	Track job materials with lot quantities.
•	Generate packing slips automatically, as required, to include with shipments.
•	“Receive” items back from a vendor.

SyteLine Request for Quotes (RFQ) module allows SyteLine users to create and maintain within their SyteLine system the RFQs they send to potential vendors and subcontractors. Users can record a variety of RFQ responses including lead time, quote quantities, and price breaks for each individual RFQ. Via an optional web extension, vendors can update the RFQ records via the Internet. RFQs are created and managed out of the standard Purchase Requisition function of SyteLine. Using RFQ, a user can shop the purchase request to all or a predefined set of vendors. RFQ contains the complete flow from the creation of the RFQ Header to the selection of the winning Vendor. It helps streamline the entire purchasing process, making it more efficient and effective, helping managers make decisions to optimize use of resources.

•	Multiple Price & Quantity Breaks - Record pricing received from vendors or suppliers based on up to 10 different buckets for convenient evaluation and comparison of cost advantages based on variations to the RFQ.
•	Predefined Vendor Sets - Determine specifically which vendors or suppliers will be given the option to submit a quote based on the item or product code that is being purchased. (For example: One set of vendors may be used for buying materials but another set may be used for purchasing electronics.)
•	Automatic Vendor/Supplier - Have the system automatically generate a list of vendors/suppliers to use based on the standard Syteline Vendor/Item Ranking, a past RFQ, or one of the Predefined Vendor Sets.
•	Multiple Quote Distribution -- Generate quotes and send to vendors or suppliers via email, fax, printed and mailed, or posted on the Internet via the Web add-on module.
•	One-Time Vendor Support - The system will also support the use of vendors/suppliers that are not in the standard SyteLine Vendor Master for quoting purposes only.  This will allow a user to shop without creating a vendor until it is selected.
•	Multiple Selection Methods - Select a vendor/supplier based on multiple selection methods, such as price, lead time or response time.

SyteLine Request for Quote Web Access:

•	Web access for vendors
•	Review of quote requests
•	Update of quote requests with vendor delivery & pricing
•	Feeds updates back to SyteLine RFQ

Flex2D Visualization

Flex2D reduces order errors by providing real-time visual feedback of selected options. It also eliminates non-value-added time by generating configuration-specific outputs for use by sales and manufacturing.

Flex2D is a powerful geometry engine that works with the SyteLine BuyDesign Configurator to dynamically generate dimensionally accurate 2D visuals. Outputs are produced in a variety of raster (e.g. JPG, GIF) and vector (e.g. SVG, EMF) formats that are used as:
•	2D Model Images displayed during the configuration process and in Channel Sales quote screens.
•	2D Print Images used in printed documents such as bids, proposals, product brochures, and reports.
•	Annotated Drawings that are used in submittals or as sales drawings.
•	AutoCAD and CAD Files for inclusion by engineers and designers in their own CAD drawings.

Flex2D provides immediate confirmation that a configured product looks exactly the way the customer wants it to look. It can be run interactively, as an integral part of the configuration process, or after all configuration selections are made. 

The Flex2D geometry engine can be queried for values it calculates based upon inputs from the configurator. Key driving dimensions are passed to the geometry engine which resolves the constraints and dimensional relationships to calculate the values of derived dimensions. The configurator can then use those values in the configuration session. This capability can be used to keep complex engineering logic or math external to configuration rules, reduce errors in computation by using a robust geometry engine to do the math, and improve performance by using powerful mathematical solvers built into the geometry engine.

Parametric Flex2D template models used by the geometry engine are created with the 2D sketching capabilities of the popular AutoDesk Inventor™ or SolidWorks CAD system enhanced with a Flex2D plug-in. Using this innovative approach, existing drawings can often be turned into “smart” 2D models in a matter of hours.

The resulting models enable Flex2D to automatically resolve constraints and dimensional relationships between geometric elements and perform complex calculations necessary during
configuration to generate the images dynamically. This results in reduced model design time, easy maintenance of complex logic in visual templates, optimal run-time performance.

SyteLine Document Management

Manufacturers are required to process and store an ever-expanding quantity of paper and information as compliance requirements increase. Companies must find ways to keep costs down, and respond quickly and efficiently to market demands, in order to maintain competitive positioning. This process has become more difficult not only because of the compliance issues, but also due to economic and competitive challenges.

Business-critical documents are increasingly governed by the practice of knowledge management, which advocates electronic—rather than manual—document processing, management, and retrieval. In order to comply with knowledge management principles while processing and storing a growing amount of information, enterprising companies are utilizing new document management technology.

Infor ERP SyteLine Document Management enables you to store all documents—including those relating to accounts payable, human resources, customer or vendor sign-offs, manufacturing specifications, and Material Safety Data Sheets—in one secure database that has easy-to-use query and look-up capabilities. Infor’s configurable interface allows you to view images of documents from any of the Document Management forms. Enterprising companies leverage
Document Management to improve their business in three significant ways:

Saving money

Expense Management

Employee-initiated expenses can account for a surprisingly large percentage of total corporate spending. In challenging economic times, companies that can’t track, analyze, and control these expenditures are missing an important opportunity for cost savings.

Consider, for example, the cost of unnecessary travel, unauthorized purchases, unused discounts and rebates, honest expense report errors, and under-billed clients. Other hidden costs can include the time and effort spent on administrative duties related to accounting for expenses and payments, as well as outright fraud. Organizations that gain control over employee-initiated spending and automate expense-related processes can see dramatic benefits to the bottom line.

More than just an end-to-end travel expense management solution, Infor™ Expense Management enables employees to plan and expense business travel; request and approve payment requests; capture time for charging to projects and cost centers; and calculate paid time off and overtime.  These integrated applications share a single, intuitive interface, making them easy to learn, use, and maintain. With Expense Management, the result is comprehensive control over employee-initiated corporate spending.

Infor’s expense management software allows even complex, multinational organizations to automate expense-related business processes and enforce policy compliance, reducing associated administrative costs and decreasing the opportunity for accidental error and intentional fraud. With it, you can implement instantaneous global updates to policies and processes to support continuous improvement, while simultaneously managing local policies and statutory requirements. 

Expense Management includes four core modules: Travel Plans, Reports, Payment Requests, and Timesheets. Each module features real-time policy notification, alerting employees to violations as they enter data and allowing them to provide explanations or make corrections before submitting plans or expenses; configurable workflow for alerting reviewers, obtaining necessary approvals, and then triggering events such as the issuance of plane tickets or the reimbursement of expenses; and business intelligence tools to analyze the solution’s database and search for opportunities to transform spending into savings. These applications work where you do—in your office, on the road, and around the globe. They support multiple languages and currencies, work with all international date and currency formats, and enable you to apply rules and policies specific to independent divisions or geographic locations. Expense Management also accommodates country-specific per diem rates, local taxation requirements, variable VAT rates, and mileage rates.

Benefits include:
•	Improved employee compliance with spending policies
•	Lower administrative costs
•	Increased savings through effective vendor negotiation and rebate usage
•	Reduction in unnecessary travel and purchases
•	Fewer people needed to process documents
•	Reduced manager time spent on approvals

SyteLine Mobile Access
For It Administrators and Production Supervisors (SL8.02.10), SyteLine Mobile Access puts key functions on your mobile device.
The Mobile IT functions will help the administrator identify and resolve various issues in order to help them provide a stable and responsive IT environment. There are a number of Windows Services and Processes that are required for the smooth functioning of SyteLine and other programs. Eg TaskMan, Web Server, Exchange Server etc… An IT Administrator wants to know the status of these services while they are on site or off site or away from their desk. They can create a list of services to be monitored and the SyteLine can trigger an alert (in the form of text message) to their mobile device when one of these services is stopped or not responding.  The admin can view the list of services they are monitoring on their smart device and perform task like start, stop or restart the service, if required.

Views into critical production status give the production supervisor the ability to be notified and resolve issues as they occur even when away from their desk.   Alerts can be configured to be sent in certain unexpected cases such as when the material issues are more than required or when the Actual labor hour posting is more than planned.  Using production calendar forms, planned production can be viewed for the day and into the future.
